# Portfolio
## README 

For a portfolio, I would aim for a fairly simple layout. Classic about me section, a tab for my "games" and then a tab
"projects", a tab for a resume, and a contact tab. The games would include the CS225 final project, snakegame, and ZombieGameCourse.

### Color Scheme:
I tend to lean towards dark greys in my designs. But also dark royal purples seem to add a nice tone to things. I generally
tend to avoid colored text unless used in a warning sense.

### About Me:

I am a recent graduate with B.S. in Computer Engineering from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University. I have played soccer for 18 years including 4 at a collegiate level. Being athletic is a huge part of my life despite my love for sitting behind a screen.

I plan to attend George Washington University to attain my masters in Computer Science specializing in Computer Graphics, animation, and multimedia. I have a large interest in the gaming and/or graphic development specifically.

Proficient with C/C++ but have worked with python, C#, and javascript. Always looking for a new opportunity to learn and become experienced in any language.

Experienced coursework such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Engineering Practices, Discrete Math Structures, and Microprocessors.

Ready to take on the challenges the world has presented.

 Resume Summary:
 I am a recent graduate from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University with a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering. I have worked closely with C and C++ programming, but have used python, C#, and javascript on personal projects. I partook in elective classes like software engineering, data structures and algorithms, and an online unity Udemy course in order to enhance my knowledge of software. I spent a large majority of my life balancing soccer with academics including a collegiate career of 4 years in college. It taught me multiple life skills including communication, leadership, organization, and teamwork. I am currently employed as a DoorDash driver and a SoccerShots coach. I also participated in multiple volunteer events with a group known as Girls for Good, leading to my own event called Flagstaff Walks Together in which people walked and participated in activities to raise money for the Family Food Center of Flagstaff. I will be attending George Washington Unviersity to recieve my masters in Computer Science witha  focus in graphics, animation, and multimedia.
